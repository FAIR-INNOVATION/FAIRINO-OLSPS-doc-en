SLAM mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To reduce the model-free construction time for complex workpieces such as box girders and improve workpiece construction efficiency, AIRLab has added a SLAM mapping function before the model-free construction step. The usage instructions are as follows:

Click the newly added "SLAM Mapping" icon button in the left project area, then click the "New" button. A "SLAM Mapping" pop-up window (as shown in the figure) will appear.

.. figure:: analysis/4/slam0.png
    :align: center
    :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 3-48 SLAM mapping pop-up window

At the current external axis position (Note: Please first set the zero position of the external axis; it is recommended to mark the zero position on the external axis at the same time), first add a movement node: you can click "Teach Current Position" to add a real-time point, or select an existing point to add a new one. Secondly, add a photo node. The newly added "Movement Node + Photo Node" must ensure that the robot, at the current external axis position, has a photo range that basically covers the structure of the box girder. Then add a SLAM mapping node; currently, the sub-map number must start from 0, as shown in the figure.

.. figure:: analysis/4/slam1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 3-49 Add a new "SLAM Mapping: Sub-map 0" node

Move the external axis to a new position, then follow the procedure for creating the first sub-map to add programs for subsequent sub-maps. The number of sub-maps shall be determined by the user based on the actual workpiece requirements.

.. centered:: Figure 3-65  Adding Welds

After all the weld seam editing is completed, click on the precise positioning module to obtain the automatic photo pose

The meaning of each editing item in Weld Seam Editing is detailed in Section 3.6.9. Perform workpiece positioning or fine positioning operations only after all weld seams have been edited.

.. important::
    For the editing of plug workpieces, it is only necessary to bind the plug workpiece process.

After completing the weld seam editing for plug workpieces, click the "Weld Seam Editing" module and then click the "Generate Welding Program" button. A plug welding program will be generated under the "Program" node. Subsequent operations such as generating trajectories for the created welding nodes or running the program can be performed; details are provided in Section 3.4.6.

.. important::
    Attention: If AIRLab provides too many automatic photo poses (such as far more than the number of welds), some points should be deleted or manually taught again. The teaching points only need to capture the starting and ending points of the welds.



Workpiece positioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Workpiece positioning: After editing all the welds to be welded, workpiece positioning is required. Firstly, it is necessary to create a workpiece positioning program; Click on the workpiece positioning module, click on the plus sign under workpiece positioning, and the AIRLab interface will display the workpiece positioning page as shown in the figure.

.. figure:: analysis/4/50.png
    :align: center
    :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 3-66  Adding a coarse positioning node

The workpiece positioning program consists of three node types:Capture Node,Move Node,Coarse Positioning Node.The Capture and Move nodes function identically to those in the Model-Free Construction module (see Section 4.5.2 for details).

Add a rough positioning node: After adding multiple sets of "movement + photo" nodes, add a rough positioning node and select a workpiece positioning algorithm. The rough positioning algorithms include Model-based, Cylinder Positioning, Depth Model, Depth Model 2, and Plug Recognition. The applicable scenarios for each algorithm are as follows:

- Model-based: Used for rough positioning of workpieces after model-free construction or workpiece import.
  
- Cylinder Positioning: Not yet available.
  
- Depth Model: Used for workpiece recognition in the automatic cycle operation of template programs.
  
- Depth Model 2: Applicable to the same scenarios as "Model-based", used for rough positioning of workpieces after model-free construction or workpiece import.
  
- Plug Recognition: Used for recognition and positioning of plug workpieces.
  
After selecting the workpiece positioning algorithm, click "Confirm", and a "Rough Positioning" node will be generated under the workpiece positioning program.

.. figure:: analysis/4/51.png
    :align: center
    :width: 2.5in

Global Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to reduce the possibility of robot collision during welding movement, AIRLab has added a new “Global Settings” item in the menu bar “Window” to provide robot collision detection, as shown in the figure. The interface includes four types of collision thresholds, but currently only open the null process collision detection distance threshold, which refers to the robot from the withdrawal point of the previous weld to the next weld convergence point between the null path of the collision distance.

.. figure:: analysis/4/70.png
    :align: center
    :width: 3.5in

.. centered:: Figure 3-88  Setting popup content globally

Currently, the only collision detection available to the user is for the null shift process. When self-collision detection is enabled, even if the user does not set the “DryRun Collision distance threshold (mm)” (i.e., using the default value of 0mm), AIRLab will detect the collision of the robot's null shift path, and plan a collision-free and safe path. When this parameter is set by the user, AIRLab will plan the robot's null path farther away from the obstacle based on the input threshold parameter on a collision-free basis.

After setting the parameters of collision detection, click “confirm” button to complete the parameter setting and close the “Global Settings” pop-up window. 

.. important::
    After the collision detection is enabled, users need to teach the withdrawal and convergence points for each weld when creating the weld template program.

After completing the settings of the project tree and other related parameters, the user clicks on the “One Click Start” button in the toolbar of AIRLab, and when the program runs into the obstacle avoidance planning section, AIRLab will show a “Progress Alert” pop-up window to display the current progress of the planning.

.. centered:: Figure 3-100  Cylinder Filling Process Query Pop up Window

1. Fill the bottom surface of the cylinder

Before performing cylindrical filling welding, users need to set parameters such as welding current, welding voltage, welding speed, spacing, offset, safety point selection, and swing process selection.

2. Secondary reinforcement
   
After the cylindrical filling welding is completed, secondary reinforcement welding is carried out, and the same user needs to set parameters first.

The filling interval refers to the vertical distance between two adjacent filling layers;

Inward filling offset refers to the horizontal distance between the starting point of filling and the edge of the cylinder;

The safety point name is the transition point of the robot during the filling and reinforcement process. After completing one filling or reinforcement, the robot needs to return to that point for the next welding.

Reinforcement interval refers to the vertical distance between adjacent reinforcement layers;

The upward offset of secondary reinforcement refers to the vertical interval between the starting point of the second reinforcement and the starting point of the first reinforcement;

Users can add, modify, or delete cylindrical filling processes,

New: Select "Add" as the change method, then set the process parameters and the name of the new filling process, and click the "Finish" button to add a new filling process;

When using the torch cleaning and wire cutting function for the first time, the user needs to manually teach the Torch Cleaning Safety Point, Torch Cleaning Point, Wire Cutting Safety Point, and Wire Cutting Point.Teaching method: First, open the “Torch Cleaning and Wire Cutting” dialog. According to the point addition method and the torch cleaning and wire cutting station diagram in the dialog, add the four points mentioned above. After successfully adding the points, select the corresponding point names from the dialog, configure the other parameters, and click the confirm button. The parameters on the page, along with the joint values of the four points, will be saved into the configuration file for torch cleaning and wire cutting.

After importing other projects, AIRLab will automatically read the parameters from the configuration file and add the Torch Cleaning Safety Point, Torch Cleaning Point, Wire Cutting Safety Point, and Wire Cutting Point to the point list.

.. important::
    If the position of the torch cleaning and wire cutting station has not changed, the user does not need to teach these four points again.

Automatic loop operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AIRLab offers the function of automatically cycling through welding projects, allowing users to repeatedly execute welding processes on workpieces. The detailed steps are as follows:

Step 1: Launch AIRLab, import the workpiece registration template project, and open the menu bar—select the automatic cycle operation pop-up window, as shown in the figure below.

.. important::
    AIRLab has specific requirements for the path of the workpiece registration template project. It must be placed in /Data/Work_template under the AIRLab directory. No other USD files are allowed in this folder besides the workpiece registration template project. The project name can be arbitrary.

.. figure:: analysis/4/88.png
    :align: center
    :width: 3in

.. centered:: Figure 3-106   AIRLab menu bar - Window - Auto Loop Run

Set loop parameters according to actual needs, and the introduction of each parameter is as follows:   

.. figure:: analysis/4/89.png
    :align: center
    :width: 3in

.. centered:: Figure 3-107   Automatic loop operation parameter settings

Enable Automatic Cycle Operation: If automatic cycle operation is required, click this button to activate the function.

Cycle Interval: The waiting time between cycles. For example, after the robot completes the welding process for the current workpiece, it will wait for this interval before importing the template program again to proceed with the next cycle.

Cycle Mode: There are two types,Continuous Cycle: Runs indefinitely. Fixed Cycle: The robot automatically stops after completing the set number of cycles.

Cycle Count: This parameter only needs to be set when the cycle mode is Fixed Cycle. (Note: The cycle count cannot be set to 0.)

.. important::
    Once the automatic cycle operation parameters are configured, they are automatically saved and loaded. If no changes are needed, simply import the workpiece registration template—the system will use the last saved settings without requiring repeated configuration.

Step 2: Click the "One-Click Run" icon button in the AIRLab menu bar to start executing the Workpiece Registration Template Project, initiating workpiece recognition. The recognition process is shown in the figure below.

The progress of workpiece recognition is displayed as shown in the figure below.Upon successful recognition, the matching score of the workpiece is shown Figure 3-93.

AIRLab then automatically searches for the corresponding welding project of the recognized workpiece. If the project exists in the specified path, it will be imported automatically,and terminal will show the path,as shown in the figure below.If recognition fails, AIRLab will display an error message and suggest corrective actions.

.. important::
    Welding projects must be placed in the /Data/Weld_template folder under the AIRLab directory.The welding project name must exactly match the workpiece name. For example, if the workpiece is named ZH-0-01-A, its corresponding welding project must be ZH-0-01-A.usd. If the welding project is not found in the specified path, AIRLab will fail to retrieve it and display a pop-up warning.

.. centered:: Figure 3-110  Automatically retrieve welding projects and import new projects

Step 3: After the welding project is automatically imported, AIRLab controls the robot to execute the project. Once the program completes, AIRLab and the robot enter the cycle interval wait state.

.. important::
    If different workpieces need to be replaced, users should estimate the replacement time in advance and set the "Cycle Interval" parameter accordingly. If no workpiece replacement is needed, the cycle interval can be set to 0 or 1 (minimal delay).

Step 4: After the waiting period ends, the next cycle begins. AIRLab automatically clears the current project and re-imports the Workpiece Registration Template Project.Upon successful import, AIRLab controls the robot to restart workpiece recognition.f recognition succeeds, AIRLab searches for the corresponding welding project. If the project exists, Step 3 is repeated.

Step 5:AIRLab automatically controls the robot to repeat Step 4 based on the configured Cycle Mode and Cycle Count until all automatic welding cycles are completed，as shown in the figure below.

.. important::
    If a robot controller error or AIRLab error occurs during the cycle, the automatic operation stops immediately, requiring manual troubleshooting before resuming.

.. figure:: analysis/4/93.png

- The Weld_template folder (storing welding template programs)  

- The entity folder (storing workpiece and tool models)  

- The database file Airlab_weld_process.db(storing user-created welding process data)  

Located in the data folder under the main directory:

- The output folder (for models)  

- The register_model folder (for auto-saved model files)  

- The weld_seam_database folder (for weld seam databases)  

If the data backup and restoration type is "Single Template Data", you need to first open the template project in AIRLab, then click the "Export" button. AIRLab will package and compress the template and its dependent files, and place the output compressed file in the /Downloads directory of the main folder. The file name is the workpiece name with the .tar.gz extension, such as ZH-401-01-A.tar.gz. Similarly, AIRLab will write the version of the current single template data package into the single_version.txt document within the package for version matching verification.

During the export process, AIRLab will display a pop-up window indicating that the data package is being exported, as shown in the figure below. If cancellation is needed, click the "Cancel Export" button in the pop-up.

Program configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The program configuration page is used to configure the program before running it, including the program configuration section and the welding interrupt recovery configuration section, as shown in the figure below.  

.. figure:: analysis/4/107.png
    :align: center
    :width: 3in

.. centered:: Figure 3-137  Program Configuration Page

The program configuration section includes program running configuration, program recognition configuration,program arc initiation configuration, no model construction settings, welding machine number selection and so on.

.. figure:: analysis/4/108.png
    :align: center
    :width: 3in

.. centered:: Figure 3-138  Program Configuration

For program operation configuration, you can select either "Do Not Run Program After Recognition" or "Run Program After Recognition": 

- Do Not Run Program After Recognition: The welding program will not run automatically after the fine positioning program is executed. 

- Run Program After Recognition: The welding program will run automatically after the fine positioning program is executed.

The program recognition configuration is divided into rough positioning first followed by fine positioning, with the option to run only fine positioning.  

- Rough Positioning Followed by Fine Positioning: After clicking the one-click run button, AIRLab will automatically execute the workpiece positioning program in the current project first, followed by the fine positioning program.  

- Run Only Fine Positioning: After starting with one-click run, AIRLab will skip the workpiece positioning step and directly execute the fine positioning program.

For arc ignition configuration, you can set it to "Arc Ignition" or "No Arc Ignition": 

- Arc Ignition: If there is an arc ignition command in the program, arc ignition and welding will be performed during program operation. 

- No Arc Ignition: No arc ignition will occur during program operation; the robot will only move along the welding trajectory for simulated welding. 

You can set the simulated welding operation speed multiplier to increase the speed of the simulated welding process.

No model building setup: Currently, there are two methods - rebuilding and not rebuilding.

- Rebuilding: Reconstruct the model of the model free workpiece; Suitable for non model artifacts that have not been built before or have poor construction results and need to be rebuilt.

- Not rebuild: If you choose not to rebuild, the model free artifact model will not be rebuilt and will be directly imported from the previously built model. Applicable to previously built model free artifacts, there is no need to re model the model free artifact.

.. important::
    In practical operation, it is recommended to separately carry out the process of building model free artifacts, and after the artifact is successfully built, operate according to the original average model method. In the absence of a model workpiece model, it is recommended to always select "not rebuild" as the parameter for model free construction settings, as the weld seam numbers obtained from model free construction may change during each construction!

After configuring everything, click the "Confirm" button to complete the program configuration.

Welding interruption recovery configuration refers to clearing the parameters that need to be configured to continue welding when the program is interrupted during the welding process; Including the configuration of parameters for detecting unexpected interruptions in welding arc tracking and weld interruption detection.

.. figure:: analysis/4/109.png
    :align: center
    :width: 3in

.. centered:: Figure 3-139  Welding interruption recovery configuration

The parameter configuration for detecting unexpected interruptions in welding arc tracking is aimed at configuring parameters for arc interruptions during the welding process, including selecting whether to detect and configuring the duration of arc interruption confirmation.

- Whether to detect: Indicates whether to detect accidental interruption of welding arc tracking.

- Confirmation duration of arc interruption: Define how many milliseconds arc interruption belongs to arc interruption and needs to be restored.

After configuration, click the "Confirm" button to complete the parameter configuration for detecting accidental interruption of welding arc tracking.

The configuration of welding interruption detection parameters is the parameters required to restore the interrupted robot motion after the program interruption during the welding process, including selecting whether to restore the welding interruption, configuring the overlap distance of the weld seam, configuring the speed of the robot returning to the arc starting point, and configuring the robot motion.

- Whether to restore welding interruption: Select restore. After the welding interruption, a pop-up window will pop up indicating the welding interruption. Clear the error before restoring the interruption, otherwise the interruption will not be restored.

- Overlap distance of weld seam: the overlap distance between the interrupted position and the previous interrupted position after resuming welding.

- Robot returning to arc starting point speed: The speed at which the robot returns to the set arc starting point after the interruption is restored.

- Robot movement to arc starting point mode: After restoring the interrupt, the robot returns to the set arc starting point mode, which can be selected as LIN or PTP mode.

After configuration, click the "Confirm" button to complete the configuration of welding interruption detection parameters.

After the welding interruption recovery configuration is fully configured, run the program. When a welding interruption signal is detected, the following pop-up window will pop up.

.. centered:: Figure 3-145   Opening format of AIRLab multilingual files

Next is to write a CSV file for the user. When setting a new language, the user only needs to modify the contents of the first column language_id and the fourth column translation_text. Assuming the user has added French, replace all "English" in the first column of Figure 3-128 with "Français"; The content of the fourth column translation_text needs to be translated by the user based on the Chinese text of "source_text" to obtain the corresponding target language (for the same string appearing in the source text, please translate it into the same word).

.. important::
    Please do not modify any characters under the "source_text" column!

After completing the translation work, the user needs to rename the CSV file to a file name that is the table name of the language data table in the AIRLab language database. For example, the file name "en_translations table" in Figure 3-129 is the table name of the language type "English" in the database.

.. important::
    It is recommended to preserve the language characteristics of the user CSV file naming to avoid duplication with the names of existing language data tables in the database, which may result in errors where the contents of other language data tables are replaced.

Finally, import the CSV file into the AIRLab software, copy the file to the execution directory of the AIRLab software, click the "Import" button, and select the file to import, as shown in Figure 3-129. The AIRLab terminal displays “CSV file import successful”, indicating that the user's language file has been successfully imported, as shown in Figure 3-128. After restarting AIRLab, select the user's newly added language switch from the drop-down menu in "Language Selection".

If the terminal displays "CSV file import failed", you can check the error message in the log record, and carefully check whether the imported CSV file is inconsistent with the originally exported CSV file in terms of the number of rows, columns, and the Chinese delimiter "；" between columns.

.. important::
    When modifying the content of "translation_text", it is necessary to refer to the field length of the Chinese text of "source_text". If the translation value is too long, please use abbreviations appropriately, otherwise the corresponding control text in the AIRLab interface may not be displayed completely.

(3) User modifies existing language in AIRLab

If the user needs to modify an existing language in AIRLab, they first need to click the "Export" button to export the CSV file of that language; After the modification is completed, copy the file to the execution directory of AIRLab software, click the "Import" button, select the modified file to import, and the terminal displays "CSV import successful". After restarting the software, the language modification is completed.

Considering the different usage habits of AIRLab English users, AIRLab-V1.0.2 version has designed the unit of measurement switching as a configuration item for users to choose whether to switch millimeters to inches, as shown in Figure 3-130.

Extended Axis Coordinate System Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AIRLab provides a calibration function for the Extended Axis Coordinate System. After normally importing the robot, tools, and external axes, click "Import Module" - "External Axes" on the main interface,open the extended axis settings interface (see Section 3.5.1). Then, select the extended axis coordinate system to calibrate and click “Modify” to enter the Extended Axis Coordinate System Calibration interface, as shown below.

    Exaxis0 cannot be calibrated. If you select Exaxis0, an error dialog will appear as shown below.

A AIRLab provides a calibration method specifically for extended axes of the type “Single Degree-of-Freedom Linear Rail.” The detailed procedure is as follows:

Step 1: First, open the "Extended Axis Coordinate System Calibration" interface mentioned earlier. Click the "Clear Coordinate System" button, and confirm the "Whether the currently applied tool coordinate system has been calibrated" option. The prerequisite for calibrating the external axis is that the tool coordinate system used in the current application has been correctly calibrated. After confirmation, an "Inquiry" pop-up window will appear. Once confirmed, the calibration setup will officially begin.

.. centered:: Figure 3-155   Calibration interface (left) and Inquiry dialog (right)

Step 2: Click “Servo Enable.” If successful, the button will turn green; otherwise, it will remain red and an error dialog will appear. After enabling successfully, click “Zero Point Setting” to complete the initial setup.

.. centered:: Figure 3-156   Servo enable and zero point setting

Step 3: Keep the extended axis fixed. Change the robot tool’s pose so that the tool aligns with a fixed reference point on the extended axis. Click “Set Point 1.” Once the button changes to “Modify Point 1,” the point has been recorded. To modify, repeat the process. Similarly, adjust the pose to record Point 2.

.. centered:: Figure 3-157   Setting Point 1 and Point 2

Step 4: Click “Forward Jog” to move the extended axis a certain distance (note the number of clicks—you will need to return to the original zero point later). Then adjust the robot tool pose again to align with the same fixed reference point. Click “Set Point 3.” Once the button changes to “Modify Point 3,” the point has been recorded. Modify if needed by repeating the operation.

.. centered:: Figure 3-158   Setting Point 3

Step 5: Click “Reverse Jog” to move the extended axis back to the zero point. Adjust the robot tool pose again to align with the same fixed reference point, then jog along the base coordinate system to move the tool slightly upward (vertically above the fixed point). Click “Set Point 4.” Once the button changes to “Modify Point 4,” the point has been recorded. Modify if needed by repeating the operation.

Step 7: Once the calculation results are verified, click “Save.” The results will be stored in the local path:
~/AIRLabExe/Data/import_config/Cleargun_cutwire_settings.config
under [Exaxis_coord_value_list]. In this example, Exaxis1 was calibrated, so the result is saved as <1 = “calibration result”>. At the same time, the Extended Axis Settings will display Exaxis1 as successfully calibrated.

If the calibrated external axis coordinate system is correct (with RX, RY, and RZ values close to 0), click the "Apply" button to send the calibrated external axis coordinate system to the robot controller for application.
